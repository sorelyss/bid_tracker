Tired of pass up an offer? This scripts can do the hard work searching the best deal of a product at different stores. 
It searches the product using [Selenium](http://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/) and notifies you in Windows using [Windows 10 Toast Notifications](https://github.com/jithurjacob/Windows-10-Toast-Notifications)

### TODO:
- Schedule the scripts (https://blogs.esri.com/esri/arcgis/2013/07/30/scheduling-a-scrip/).
- Make easier the product price search. Read [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_shopping_website).
